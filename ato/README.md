# ATO Repository Setup Script

This script automates the process of cloning, setting up, and running the ATO repository.

## What This Script Does

1. Clones the repository from https://github.com/huannv-sys/ato.git
2. Automatically detects the project type (Node.js, Python, Java, etc.)
3. Sets up the appropriate development environment
4. Installs dependencies
5. Attempts to run the application

## Requirements

- Git
- Depending on the project type, you may need:
  - Node.js and npm
  - Python 3
  - Java and Maven
  - Go
  - Ruby and Bundler
  - PHP and Composer
  - Gradle

## Usage

1. Make the script executable:
   ```
   chmod +x clone_and_setup.sh
   ```

2. Run the script:
   ```
   ./clone_and_setup.sh
   ```

3. Follow any additional instructions that the script outputs.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

1. Check if you have the necessary runtime installed for the project type
2. Review the error messages for specific problems
3. Check the repository's original documentation for specific setup instructions
4. Make sure you have the necessary permissions to install packages

## Note

If the script can't automatically detect how to run the application, it will display the README from the repository and list the top-level files to help you determine the next steps.
